# Bank-Card-Transaction-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a bank card transaction dataset using various data analysis and machine learning techniques. The analysis is divided into two main parts:

## Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression Analysis

### Dataset
The project utilizes a bank card transaction dataset containing information about transactions, including amounts, timestamps, and associated features.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, identify patterns, and understand the distribution of variables.

### Hypothesis Testing
Several hypotheses related to transaction patterns and user behavior are formulated and tested to uncover significant insights.

### Regression Analysis
Regression analysis, employing Ridge, Lasso, and Linear Regression models, is conducted to predict transaction amounts based on relevant features.

## Part 2: RFM Analysis and Frequent Pattern Mining

### RFM Analysis
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is performed using KMeans clustering to segment customers based on their transaction behavior.

### Frequent Pattern Mining
Mining frequent patterns from transaction data helps identify common sequences of transactions or itemsets, providing valuable insights into user behavior.
